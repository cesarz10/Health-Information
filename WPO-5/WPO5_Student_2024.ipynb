    "# Lung Nodule Analysis \n",
    "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Screening high risk individuals for lung cancer with low-dose CT scans is now being implemented in the United States and other countries are expected to follow soon. In CT lung cancer screening, millions of CT scans will have to be analyzed, which is an enormous burden for radiologists. Therefore, there is a lot of interest in development of computer algorithms to optimize cancer screening.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/luna16_image.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "A vital first step in the analysis of lung cancer CT scans is the detection of pulmonary nodules, which may or may not represent early stage lung cancer. Many computer-aided detection (CAD) systems have already been proposed for this task. \n",
    "\n",
    "The LIDC/IDRI data set is publicly available, including the ground-truth annotations of nodules performed by four radiologists.\n",
    "\n",
    "This practical session is inspired from the challenge [LUNA16](https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/home/), which focused on a large-scale evaluation of automatic nodule detection algorithms on the LIDC/IDRI data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/lung_cancer1.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using LIDC/IDRI data set in this practical session\n",
    "\n",
    "For the needs of this practical session, we will look for an algorithm that only determines the likelihood for a given location in a CT scan to contain a pulmonary nodule. Furthermore, we have included a very small part of the LIDC/IDRI data set and we will use only a slice of suspicious regions of a CT scan.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally our dataset was very unbalanced. There were a lot samples of non-nodules (negatives) but very few samples of nodules (positives). Machine learning algorithms and specifically neural networks and convolutional neural networks require to be trained on balanced dataset, meaning all the classes should be equally represented in the training set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using data augmentation methods (**rotation and translation**), positive samples were massively augmented in order to balance the two classes (nodules and non-nodules)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ground Truth data\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical data are variables that contain label values rather than numeric values. In our dataset, a sample can represent a nodule or a non-nodule area, so initially we have our ground truth data in a categorical form. Many machine learning algorithms cannot operate on label data directly. They require all input variables to be numeric. This means that categorical data must be converted to a numerical form. This involves two steps:\n",
    "1. Integer Encoding\n",
    "2. One-Hot Encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, each unique category value is assigned an integer value. That's why in our dataset, a sample which represents a nodule will have as a label `1` and a sample which represents a non-nodule area will have as a label `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our case, this enconding step would be enough since we have only two categories. However, in a more general problem with more than two classes, using this encoding allows the model to assume a natural ordering between categories which may result in poor performance or unexpected results. That's why, one hot encoding can be appled to the integer representation. This is where the integer encoded variable is removed and a new binary variable is added for each unique integer value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, a  nodule will be represented by the binary variable `[1,0]` and a non-nodule area by the binary variable `[0,1]`.\n",

    "First, lets train our classifier using an artificial neural network with just one layer (perceptron), a fully connected one (dense). This layer will have `softmax` as activation function and only two neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of using this activation function is the output range. The range of the outputs will be `[0,1]` and the sum of all the probabilities will be equal to one. Generally, if the softmax function is used for a  multi-classification model it returns the probabilities of each class and the target class will have higher probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Keras, define your model. Use these hyperparameters:\n",
    "* Learning Rate = `1e-4`\n",
    "* Batch Size = `8`\n",
    "* Optimizer = `sgd`\n",
    "* Loss metric = `categorical_crossentropy`\n",
    "* Validation metric score in Keras = `accuracy`\n",
    "\n",
    "Check your model architecture with `summary()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the network is small, it is not recommended to use `Dropout`. Train first for 1-2 epochs to verify that everything works and then train for ~10 epochs. To automatically integrate `wandb` in your Keras `model.fit` function, import `from wandb.keras import WandbMetricsLogger` and add a callback statement: `callbacks=[WandbMetricsLogger()]`. Observe the training and evaluate graphs from `wandb` to decide when to stop training. \n",
