        "### Goal\n",
        "The goal of this practical session is to obtain insight in basic data analysis and data visualization techniques using Jupyter notebook. Basic operations presented today will be very useful during the next practical sessions, where you will need to design and build different decision systems. In this practical session, basic libraries like *pandas*, *matplotlib* and *seaborn* are introduced and applied to the Wisconsin breast cancer data set. Students must send their notebook using Assignment functionality of Canvas using .ipynb __and__ .html format __before 23:59 on the 22th of February__. All practical sessions are graded. Additionally, a general feedback will be provided in the next practical session.\n",

        "__Hints__ for all practical sessions:\n",
        "- Make sure that the code is pre-compiled and all output is generated correctly before handing in your notebook\n",
        "- Pay attention to the layout of your figures (labels, titles, legends, colors,...)\n",
        "- Chose relevant abbreviations for your variables, make sure your variables are not overwritten\n",

Notebook documents contain both computer code (python) and text elements (paragraphs, equations, figures,...). In this way, notebook files can serve as a complete computational record of a session, interleaving executable code with explanatory text, mathematics, and rich representations of resulting objects. Notebooks may be exported to a range of static formats, including HTML, reStructuredText, LaTeX and PDF. Basic functionalities of the Jupyter notebook are presented [here](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html).\n",

        "\n",
        "To import any external library, you need to import it using the **import** statement followed by the name of the library and the shortcut. The following code imports Pandas and represents it as 'pd'. You can additionally check for the module version using __version__ command.
