    "### Goal\n",
    "The goal of this practical session is to obtain insight in basic data analysis and data visualization techniques using Jupyter notebook. Basic operations presented today will be very useful during the next practical sessions, where you will need to design and build different decision systems. In this practical session, basic libraries like *pandas*, *matplotlib* and *seaborn* are introduced and applied to the Wisconsin breast cancer data set. Students must send their notebook using Assignment functionality of Canvas using .ipynb __and__ .html format __before 23:59 on the 22th of February__. All practical sessions are graded. Additionally, a general feedback will be provided in the next practical session. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Hints__ for all practical sessions:\n",
    "- Make sure that the code is pre-compiled and all output is generated correctly before handing in your notebook\n",
    "- Pay attention to the layout of your figures (labels, titles, legends, colors,...)\n",
    "- Chose relevant abbreviations for your variables, make sure your variables are not overwritten\n",
    "- Read all assignments thoroughly\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebook is an open-source application that allows editing and running notebook documents via a web browser. Notebook documents contain both computer code (python) and text elements (paragraphs, equations, figures,...). In this way, notebook files can serve as a complete computational record of a session, interleaving executable code with explanatory text, mathematics, and rich representations of resulting objects. Notebooks may be exported to a range of static formats, including HTML, reStructuredText, LaTeX and PDF. Basic functionalities of the Jupyter notebook are presented [here](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html).\n",
    "***\n",
    "### The breast cancer Wisconsin (diagnostic) data set\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fine needle aspirate procedure:\n",
    "The dataset consists of features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. For this type of biopsy technique, a thin hollow needle is inserted into an area of abnormal-appearing tissue for sampling cells. This sample is examined under a microscope which is used in the diagnosis of cancer. FNA is generally considered a safe procedure. \n",
    "***\n",
    "#### FNA images:\n",
    "The image below represents a smear of nuclei of benign and malignant breast mass cells. A difference in shape, size and smoothness of cells is visible.\n",

    "***\n",
    "#### Features:\n",
    "In oder to describe the images with numerical values, which can be easily interpreted by a computer, the features term has to be introduced. Features describe characteristics of the nuclei present in the microscopic image. Usually, the more of independent features describing the image, the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each cell nuclei has an independent set of features describing its individual properties:\n",
    "- ID number of the patient from which the cell was collected.\n",
    "- The medical diagnosis label assessed by a histologist/oncologist: Malignant or Benign. \n",
    "- The mean, standard deviation and the 3 worst values of 10 features describing mathematical properties of a cell were computed. This included:\n",
    "        a) radius (distance from center to points on the perimeter)\n",
    "        b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)\n",
    "        c) perimeter\n",
    "        d) area\n",
    "        e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)\n",
    "        f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)\n",
    "        g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)\n",
    "        h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)\n",
    "        i) symmetry\n",
    "        j) fractal dimension (a measure of cells self-similarity)\n",
    "  \n",
    "Some features were computed automatically using automatic image processing algorithms, and others acquired manually by medical experts. Microscopic images of 569 cells were analyzed and labeled as benign or malignant. \n",
    "Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant.\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "During this practical session, multiple libraries will be used for the analysis and visualization of data. You can use a different version of libraries, however we recommend the following build:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [__Pandas__](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html):     high performance library used for processing data structures and data analysis. __V 0.22.0__ \n",
    "- [__Numpy__](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html):      library used for scientific computing containing N-dimensional arrays, functions and Fourier transform. __V 1.13.3__ \n",
    "- [__Sci-kit Learn__](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html):     Simple and efficient tools for machine learning and data analysis. __V 0.19.1__ \n",
    "- [__Matplotlib__](https://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html): plotting library used for the visualization of data from python. __V 2.1.0__ \n",
    "- [__Seaborn__](https://seaborn.pydata.org/):    visualization library based on matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics. __V 0.8.1__ \n",
    "\n",
    "To import any external library, you need to import it using the **import** statement followed by the name of the library and the shortcut. The following code imports Pandas and represents it as 'pd'. You can additionally check for the module version using __version__ command. Information on updating the libraries using Anaconda can be found  [here](http://conda-test.pydata.org/docs/examples/update.html)."

However, with very large numbers of instances, all plotted points tent to become inseparable, forming one large cluster of the same color intensity. That issue can be solved by introduction of density plots. Density plot represents data in the same way as the scatterplot, but it changes its density dependent on the number of points in its vicinity. Using *seaborn* library and *kdeplot* function, plot a density plot of the same features (radius in function of texture) for two class labels (benign and malignant) on the same figure. You can easily see that it is much easier now to interpret and separate features.\n",

Use a complete dataset to create a scatter_matrix plot. \n",
