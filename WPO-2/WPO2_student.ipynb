Patients over 50 (about 30% of the population) have the biggest chance of being exposed to pollution (60%), which is significantly more than patients with ages below 50 (10%). Patients over 50 are also more likely to smoke. In fact, one in four males over 50 still smokes, while only 13% of females over 50 smokes.
